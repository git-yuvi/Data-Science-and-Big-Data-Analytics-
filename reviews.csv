RU300RKHU9AW4,Ayush Kamboj,"Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 June 2022,Best Battery. Best Camera. Very smooth.

R4MT8G85778SX,DS,I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 11 April 2022,The best ever phone in the market,5,,11,,
